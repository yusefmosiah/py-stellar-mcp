# Session Progress Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Focus:** SDEX Trading Integration & Market Order Logic

---

## 1. Fixed Market Buy Logic

### Problem
- Market buy test was failing with "Insufficient liquidity: only 0.0793905 available"
- Semantics of SDEX orderbook were confusing (buy/sell, bid/ask orientation)
- Market orders were correctly implemented but order size was too large for available liquidity

### Solution
- ✅ Reduced test order size from 0.05 to 0.02 USDC
- ✅ Confirmed semantics are correct in `stellar_tools_v2.py:31-172`
- ✅ All 15/15 tests now pass with 100% success rate
- ✅ Real market trade executed: Acquired 0.02 USDC at 892.38 XLM/USDC

### Key Understanding
**When buying USDC with XLM:**
- You're SELLING XLM to GET USDC
- In `orderbook(XLM, USDC)`, the BIDs are people buying XLM (selling USDC)
- To buy USDC, you match against the BIDs
- Price shown is USDC/XLM, need to convert to XLM/USDC for user display

---

## 2. Key Manager Persistence

### Changes Made
**File:** `key_manager.py`

- ✅ Added file-based persistence to `.stellar_keystore.json`
- ✅ Automatic save on `store()` and `import_keypair()`
- ✅ Automatic load on `__init__()`
- ✅ Secure file permissions: 600 (owner read/write only)
- ✅ Added `.stellar_keystore.json` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Tested and verified persistence across KeyManager instances

### Benefits
- Keys now persist across script runs
- Can use web faucet to fund accounts with USDC (rate-limited)
- Accounts are recoverable after session restart

---

## 3. Market Making Setup

### Test Accounts Created
All accounts funded with XLM and have USDC trustlines established:

**Account 1:** `GDNT3Q4WLRJRR7AYDFFDSO7AMESCXQQRJUMRSGLFOTXTPJNA6C4MEPLX`
- 10 USDC (from web faucet)
- ~10,000 XLM
- [Explorer](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GDNT3Q4WLRJRR7AYDFFDSO7AMESCXQQRJUMRSGLFOTXTPJNA6C4MEPLX)

**Account 2:** `GAZZZCEIHMOS4G3RELXFWHTMKOZQU2QBXNNUZPPNQDNTJKAAK3YYCC2A`
- 10 USDC (from web faucet)
- ~10,000 XLM
- [Explorer](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GAZZZCEIHMOS4G3RELXFWHTMKOZQU2QBXNNUZPPNQDNTJKAAK3YYCC2A)

**Test Account 3:** `GATEUM62G2DRTS5T23FF2YYTZRUYTRV5CALVYCUXT3NEEDZHLB3SEQFS`
- Created to test order fills (can't fill own orders - `op_cross_self` error)
- Successfully bought 2 USDC by selling XLM
- [Explorer](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/account/GATEUM62G2DRTS5T23FF2YYTZRUYTRV5CALVYCUXT3NEEDZHLB3SEQFS)

### Orders Placed
**Liquidity Ladder (both accounts):**
- 1 USDC @ 1000 XLM/USDC (willing to pay 1000 XLM to get 1 USDC)
- 1 USDC @ 500 XLM/USDC
- 1 USDC @ 100 XLM/USDC
- 1 USDC @ 50 XLM/USDC
- ~~1 USDC @ 10 XLM/USDC~~ ✅ FILLED by test account

**Total:** 8 USDC remaining on the orderbook across 2 accounts

### Order Fill Test Results
✅ **Confirmed automatic fills work:**
- Test account placed buy order at 15 XLM/USDC
- Order immediately filled against 10 XLM/USDC offers
- Acquired 2 USDC (1 from each account) for ~20 XLM
- ⚠️ **Important:** Cannot self-trade (`op_cross_self` error in Stellar)

## 4. Current Orderbook State

**USDC/XLM Testnet Market:**

**BIDS (offering USDC to get XLM):**
1. 2 USDC @ 50 XLM/USDC
2. 2 USDC @ 100 XLM/USDC
3. 2 USDC @ 500 XLM/USDC
4. 2 USDC @ 1000 XLM/USDC

**ASKS (offering XLM to get USDC):**
1. 30 XLM @ 15 XLM/USDC (test account unfilled remainder)
2. 40 XLM @ 5 XLM/USDC (our earlier test orders)
3. 115.18 XLM @ 4 XLM/USDC
4. 103,749 XLM @ 1 XLM/USDC

**Spread:** Wide, but functional for testing

---

## 5. Code Structure (v2 Composite Tools)

**Files:**
- `stellar_tools_v2.py` - 5 composite tools (70% reduction from v1)
- `key_manager.py` - Persistent keypair storage
- `server_v2.py` - MCP server implementation
- `test_sdex_trading_v2.py` - Integration tests (15/15 passing)

**Composite Tools:**
1. `account_manager()` - create, fund, get, transactions, list, export, import
2. `trading()` - market_buy, market_sell, limit_buy, limit_sell, cancel, orders
3. `trustline_manager()` - establish, remove
4. `market_data()` - orderbook queries
5. `utilities()` - status, fee estimation

---

## 6. Known Issues & Next Steps

### Current Semantic Confusion

**Problem:** Trading semantics are inverted from user intuition

**Current API:**
```python
trading(
    action="limit_buy",      # Confusing: buying what?
    base_asset="XLM",        # Mental model clash
    quote_asset="USDC",      # Which am I buying?
    amount="4",              # 4 of what?
    price="15"               # Price in what terms?
)
```

**User Intent:**
- "I want to buy 4 USDC by selling XLM"
- "I want to sell 10 XLM to get USDC"

### Proposed Refactoring

Make API explicit about WHAT you're buying/selling:

```python
trading_v3(
    action="buy",            # Clear: buying
    buy_asset="USDC",        # This is what I want
    sell_asset="XLM",        # This is what I'm spending
    amount="4",              # 4 USDC
    price="15"               # Willing to pay 15 XLM per USDC
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clearer intent
- No base/quote confusion
- Matches user mental model
- Easier to explain in MCP tool descriptions

---

## 7. Test Reports

Latest successful run: `test_reports/sdex_trading_v2_report_20251023_190538.md`
- **15/15 tests passed** ✅
- Real market trade executed
- Full transaction flow verified

---

## 8. Files Modified This Session

1. `test_sdex_trading_v2.py` - Fixed buy amount (0.05 → 0.02), fixed variable refs
2. `key_manager.py` - Added file persistence with JSON storage
3. `.gitignore` - Added `.stellar_keystore.json`
4. **Created:** `.stellar_keystore.json` (not in git, contains 3 keypairs)

---

## 9. Semantic Refactoring Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-23 (after context compaction)

### Problem Solved
The old API was confusing because it used base/quote terminology that required understanding orderbook internals:
```python
# Old (confusing):
trading(action="limit_buy", base_asset="XLM", quote_asset="USDC",
        amount="4", price="15")  # 4 of what? Price means what?
```

### New API: Explicit Buying/Selling Semantics

**Matches Stellar's Native Design Philosophy:**
- Stellar SDK has separate `manage_buy_offer` and `manage_sell_offer`
- Both specify explicit `buying_asset` and `selling_asset`
- Our API now mirrors this intuitive approach

**New API Signature:**
```python
trading(
    action: str,  # "buy", "sell", "cancel_order", "get_orders"
    buying_asset: str,
    selling_asset: str,
    buying_issuer: Optional[str] = None,
    selling_issuer: Optional[str] = None,
    amount: str,  # Interpreted based on action
    price: Optional[str] = None,  # For limit orders
    order_type: str = "limit",  # "limit" or "market"
    ...
)
```

### Clear Examples

**Buy USDC with XLM (Market Order):**
```python
trading(action="buy", order_type="market",
        buying_asset="USDC", selling_asset="XLM",
        buying_issuer=USDC_ISSUER, amount="0.02")
# Clear: Buy 0.02 USDC at market price using XLM
```

**Buy USDC with XLM (Limit Order):**
```python
trading(action="buy", order_type="limit",
        buying_asset="USDC", selling_asset="XLM",
        buying_issuer=USDC_ISSUER, amount="4", price="15")
# Clear: Buy 4 USDC, willing to pay 15 XLM per USDC
```

**Sell XLM for USDC (Limit Order):**
```python
trading(action="sell", order_type="limit",
        selling_asset="XLM", buying_asset="USDC",
        buying_issuer=USDC_ISSUER, amount="100", price="0.01")
# Clear: Sell 100 XLM, want 0.01 USDC per XLM
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Internal Translation Layer:**
   - User provides buying/selling semantics
   - Code determines orderbook orientation (XLM is base when paired with issued assets)
   - Queries appropriate orderbook for market orders
   - Translates to correct Stellar operations (ManageBuyOffer or ManageSellOffer)

2. **Amount Interpretation:**
   - For `action="buy"`: amount = quantity of buying_asset to acquire
   - For `action="sell"`: amount = quantity of selling_asset to give up

3. **Price Interpretation:**
   - For `action="buy"`: price = selling_asset per buying_asset
   - For `action="sell"`: price = buying_asset per selling_asset

### Test Results

✅ **All 15/15 tests passed** with new API
- Account creation and funding
- Trustline establishment
- Orderbook queries
- Limit buy orders with new semantics
- Order cancellation
- **Real market buy executed:** 0.02 USDC at 50 XLM/USDC

**Test report:** `test_reports/sdex_trading_v2_report_20251023_194356.md`

### Files Modified

1. **stellar_tools_v2.py:**
   - Refactored `trading()` function signature and implementation
   - Updated `_calculate_market_fill()` comments for clarity
   - Internal orderbook orientation logic for market orders

2. **test_sdex_trading_v2.py:**
   - Updated all trading() calls to new semantics
   - Changed actions: `market_buy` → `buy` with `order_type="market"`
   - Changed actions: `limit_buy` → `buy` with `order_type="limit"`
   - Changed actions: `orders` → `get_orders`
   - Changed actions: `cancel` → `cancel_order`

3. **server_v2.py:**
   - Updated `trading_tool()` MCP description
   - Clear examples for LLM agents (Claude)
   - Explicit buying/selling terminology throughout

### Architecture Validation

**Horizon vs RPC Research:**
- ✅ Confirmed Horizon is the **correct API** for SDEX trading
- Stellar RPC (Soroban) is for smart contracts, **cannot interact with SDEX**
- No migration needed - our architecture is already optimal

### Benefits Achieved

✅ **Intuitive for users and LLMs:**
- "Buy USDC with XLM" is expressed naturally
- No need to understand base/quote orientation

✅ **Matches Stellar's design:**
- Uses same buying/selling concepts as native SDK
- Respects Stellar's separation of buy vs sell offers

✅ **Maintains full control:**
- All limit order functionality preserved
- Market order logic unchanged
- Price and amount semantics clear

✅ **Zero test failures:**
- Backward breaking changes acceptable (prototype)
- All 15/15 tests pass immediately
